# Plan to Implement `sonner` Toast Notifications

Here is the plan to add success toast notifications for user registration.

## 1. Installation

The `sonner` component will be installed using the `shadcn/ui` CLI. This is the recommended method as it handles the setup automatically.

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add sonner
```

This command will create the file `components/ui/sonner.tsx` and install the required dependencies.

## 2. Add Toaster to Root Layout

To ensure the toast notifications are available globally throughout the application, the `Toaster` component must be added to the root layout file, which is `app/layout.tsx`.

```tsx
import { Toaster } from "@/components/ui/sonner"

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <head />
      <body>
        <main>{children}</main>
        <Toaster />
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

## 3. Trigger a Success Toast

To trigger a toast notification from a client-side function, the `toast` function from the `sonner` library needs to be imported. To display a success-specific toast, the `toast.success()` method will be used.

Here is an example of how a success toast for user registration would be triggered:

```tsx
"use client"

import { toast } from "sonner"
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"

export function RegisterButton() {
  const handleRegister = () => {
    // ... user registration logic
    toast.success("User successfully registered!")
  }

  return <Button onClick={handleRegister}>Register</Button>
}
